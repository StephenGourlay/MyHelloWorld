# MyHelloWorld
Started a fresh Hello World away from my old name

I've followed the Hello World instructions to refresh my understanding. 

## Here's a new sub-heading
Trying out some *markdown* - nice to see this editor actually **shows** roughly what you'll see.

Just for reference - here's the url of the initial exercise: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

## Keeping branches
So far I've followed the instructions - which include deleting branches after Pulling and Merging. If I wanted to keep track of changes - is this done automatically, or do I have to keep the Branch even after merging? Guess I'll find out - but in the meantime will keep this branch instead of deleting it.
